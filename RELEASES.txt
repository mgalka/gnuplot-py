These are my notes about the steps to make a new release of
Gnuplot.py.

1. Edit the following files for the release:

   NEWS.txt -- add the version number at the top of the file and make
       sure that the comments are up-to-date.

   ANNOUNCE.txt -- add the version number at the top of the file and
       update the blurbs as appropriate.

   Gnuplot.html -- update the version number where it appears.  Update
       the "News" section.

   __init__.py -- increment the __version__ string. No "+" on the end.

2. Check the changes into Subversion.

3. Tag the release in Subversion:

   $ svn cp https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gnuplot-py/trunk \
            https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gnuplot-py/tags/release-1.8

4. Create new documentation using happydoc:

   $ rm -rf doc
   $ ( cd .. ; 
       happydoc -d Gnuplot/doc -t 'Gnuplot.py' \
         --author='Michael Haggerty <mhagger@alum.mit.edu>' Gnuplot )

5. Generate the source distributions:

   $ python2 ./setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip

6. [OMIT THIS] Generate the binary distributions.  [I don't think a binary
   distribution is worthwhile because the place that the files need to
   be installed is dependent on the version of python being used.]

   $ python2 ./setup.py bdist --format=gztar,zip,rpm,wininst

7. Release the files on SourceForge:

   a. Go to the "Admin" page.

   b. Go to the "File release system" page.

   c. Click on "Add Release" for package Gnuplot-py.

   d. Type a release name of the form "1.7".

   e. Paste the "New features in this version" section of ANNOUNCE.txt
      into the "release notes" text box.

   f. Follow the instructions to release the files.

   g. Send an email to people monitoring the project with the button
      at the bottom of the release page.

8. Send an announcement to gnuplot-py-users.

9. Send an announcement to comp.lang.python.

10. Append a '+' to the __version__ string in __init__.py to
    distinguish intermediate Subversion releases from official
    releases.  Add a "Version ?.?:" line to NEWS.txt to receive future
    change notes.  Check the changes into Subversion.
