<h1>Gnuplot.py</h1>

<a href="python/Gnuplot-1.1a.tar.gz">Gnuplot.py</a> is a Python module
that interfaces to <a
href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/gnuplot_info.html">gnuplot</a>, the
popular plotting program.  It allows you to use gnuplot from within
Python to plot arrays of data from memory, data from files, or
mathematical functions.  If you use Python to perform computations or
as `glue' for numerical programs, you can use this module to plot data
on the fly as they are computed.  And the combination with Python
makes it is easy to create crude `animations' by plotting different
datasets one after another; the datasets can even be written to
temporary files in advance of the animation to increase the frame
rate.

<p> Communication with gnuplot is through a pipe (for commands) and
temporary files (for data).  It has been written and tested on a unix
computer; I don't know whether it will run under other operating
systems (please let me know if you try).

<p> This module has an object-oriented design that allows the user
flexibility to set plot options and to run multiple gnuplot sessions
simultaneously.  If you are more ambitious, it would not be difficult
to program new types of plottable items by deriving from the
`PlotItem' class.  For a demonstration, run the python file by typing
`python Gnuplot.py'.

<h2>News</h2>

Version 1.1a has been released (9 Apr 1999).  This version just
addresses a couple of minor portability issues.

<p>
Version 1.1 has been released (31 Jan 1999).  New features:
<ul>
  <li> 3-D plots are now supported through the new `splot' method:
       <ul>
	 <li> To create a scatter plot, pass splot 2-D an array
	      containing (x,y,z) triplets;
	 <li> To create a grid plot, pass a 3-D array consisting of a
	      2-D array of (x,y,z) triplets; or
	 <li> Use the new `GridData' PlotItem to plot gridded data
	      (data tabulated on a rectangular grid).
       </ul>
  <li> It is now easier to pass data to gnuplot.  The `Data' PlotItem
       now accepts multiple arguments representing subsequent
       `columns' of the dataset; e.g., what used to be written as
       <pre>
          g = Gnuplot.Gnuplot()
          x = Numeric.arange(100)/10.0
          y = x**2
          # Create an array of (x,y) pairs:
          g.plot(Gnuplot.Data(Numeric.transpose((x, y))))
       </pre>
       can now be shortened to
       <pre>
          # Plot y vs. x directly:
          g.plot(Gnuplot.Data(x, y))
       </pre>
       (both examples plot x squared vs. x).  Similarly, splot can be
       passed three arrays representing the values of x, y, and z.
       Note that the old interpretation is still used if only a single
       argument is passed to `Data'.
</ul>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

Thanks to <a
href="http://starship.skyport.net/crew/danilo/pythondoc/">
pythondoc</a>, there is now some <a
href="python/Gnuplot-doc/Gnuplot.html"> online documentation </a> for
Gnuplot.py, extracted from the module's docstrings.  Alternatively,
you can look at the docstrings in Gnuplot.py yourself by opening the
file in an editor.

<p> There is also a demonstration that you can run by typing `python
Gnuplot.py', then look at the bottom of the Gnuplot.py file to see how
the demonstration works.

<p> To get good use out of Gnuplot.py, you will want to know something
about gnuplot, for which a good source is the gnuplot help (run
gnuplot then type `help', or read it online at <a
href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/gnuplot/gnuplot.html">this
website</a>).  You might also want to check out Bernhard Reiter's <a
href="http://www.usf.Uni-Osnabrueck.DE/~breiter/tools/gnuplot/index.en.html">gnuplot
information page</a>, which has many more links.

<h2>Installation</h2>

Before installing Gnuplot.py, first make sure that you have working
versions of
<ul>
  <li> the <a
       href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/gnuplot_info.html">gnuplot</a>
       program,
  <li> <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>, and
  <li> the <a
       href="http://xfiles.llnl.gov/python.htm">Numeric Python
       extension</a>
</ul>
To install Gnuplot.py:
<ol>
  <li> Download <a
       href="python/Gnuplot-1.1a.tar.gz">Gnuplot-1.1a.tar.gz</a>.
  <li> Gunzip and untar it, which will create a directory called
       ``Gnuplot-1.1a''.  (For now, the directory only contains one
       file, ``Gnuplot.py''.)
  <li> To test the package, change to that directory and type ``python
       Gnuplot.py''.
  <li> Copy Gnuplot.py into a directory that is in your PYTHONPATH, or
       add the ``Gnuplot-1.1a'' directory to your PYTHONPATH.
</ol>
If you don't have gunzip or tar, you can download Gnuplot.py directly
from <a href="python/Gnuplot.py">here</a>.

Gnuplot.py is released under the GNU General Public License, which
means that it can be freely copied and used, but that there are some

these restrictions are a problem for you, please contact me to discuss
the issue.)

<h2>Credits</h2>

The Gnuplot.py module was written by <a
href="http://monsoon.harvard.edu/~mhagger/">Michael Haggerty</a>.

<p> The module was inspired by and partly derived from the
now-obsolete Gnuplot.py module written by <a
href="http://starship.skyport.net/crew/hinsen/">Konrad Hinsen</a>.
There is a `plot' function in this module that is roughly
backwards-compatible with the plot function in Konrad's version.

<p> Thanks also to Berthold H&ouml;llman, who set me on the trail of
pythondoc and submitted some docstring changes that helped get the
documentation going.
