<h2>Intro</h2>

<a href="Gnuplot.tar.gz">Gnuplot.py</a> is a Python package that
interfaces to <a
href="ftp://ftp.gnuplot.vt.edu/pub/gnuplot/faq/index.html">
gnuplot</a>, the popular plotting program.  It allows you to use
gnuplot from within Python to plot arrays of data from memory, data
files, or mathematical functions.  If you use Python to perform
computations or as `glue' for numerical programs, you can use this
package to plot data on the fly as they are computed.  And the
combination with Python makes it is easy to automate things, including
to create crude `animations' by plotting different datasets one after
another.

<p> Commands are communicated to gnuplot through a pipe and data
either through the same pipe (as "inline" data) or through temporary
files.  It has been written and tested on a unix computer but is also
reported to work under MS Windows, Macintosh, and possibly other
operating systems (please give me feedback!)

<p> This package has an object-oriented design that allows the user
flexibility to set plot options and to run multiple gnuplot sessions
simultaneously.  If you are more ambitious, it is not difficult to add
entirely new types of plottable items by deriving from the
`<tt>PlotItem</tt>' class.

<p> For a demonstration, run the python file by typing `<tt>python
demo.py</tt>'.

<h2>News</h2>

<a href="Gnuplot-1.4.tar.gz">Version 1.4</a> has been released (11 Oct
1999).  This version includes the following changes:

<ul>
<li> Added support for the Macintosh.
<li> Separated the platform-dependent code into separate modules:
     <tt>gp.py</tt>, <tt>gp_mac.py</tt>, and <tt>gp_win32.py</tt>.
<li> Allow access to all of the postscript printer driver options
     through the <tt>hardcopy()</tt> command.
<li> Fixed an import problem in <tt>test.py</tt>.
</ul>

<p> Version 1.3 (released 23 Sep 1999) introduced the following
features:

<ul>
<li> Converted to package format.  The main file is now called
     <tt>__init__.py</tt>, so that it can be loaded by typing
     `<tt>import Gnuplot</tt>'.
<li> Passing a callable function to <tt>GridData</tt> was broken; that
     functionality is now provided by a new type of <tt>PlotItem</tt>
     called `<tt>GridFunc</tt>'.
<li> Added a new keyword argument, `<tt>ufunc</tt>', to
     <tt>grid_function</tt> and to <tt>GridFunc</tt>, to request that
     the function be evaluated matrix-wise.
<li> Separated the demonstration code into a separate file,
     <tt>demo.py</tt>, and added a <tt>test.py</tt> module to test the
     features of <tt>Gnuplot.py</tt>.
</ul>

To read about changes introduced in earlier versions, read the <a
href="NEWS"> NEWS file</a>.


<h2>Documentation</h2>

The quickest way to learn how to use Gnuplot.py is to run the simple
demonstration by typing `<tt>python demo.py</tt>', then to look at the
<tt>demo.py</tt> file to see the commands that create the demo.  One
of the examples is probably similar to what you want to do.

<p> There is also <a href="Gnuplot-doc/"> online documentation</a> for
Gnuplot.py, extracted automatically from the package's docstrings
using <a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/danilo/pythondoc/">
pythondoc</a>.  Or you can download the html documentation to your
machine in <a href="Gnuplot-doc.tar.gz"> tar</a> or <a
href="Gnuplot-doc.zip"> zip</a> format.

<p> Finally, you can look at the docstrings yourself by opening the
file <tt>__init__.py</tt> in an editor.

<p> To get good use out of Gnuplot.py, you will want to know something
about gnuplot, for which a good source is the gnuplot help (run
gnuplot then type `help', or read it online at <a
href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/gnuplot/gnuplot.html"> this
website</a>).  You might also want to check out Bernhard Reiter's <a
href="http://www.usf.Uni-Osnabrueck.DE/~breiter/tools/gnuplot/index.en.html">
gnuplot information page</a>, which has many more links.


<h2>Installation</h2>

More detailed installation instructions are contained in the <a
href="README"> README file</a>.

Before you can use Gnuplot.py, you will need working versions of
<ul>
  <li> the <a
       href="ftp://ftp.gnuplot.vt.edu/pub/gnuplot/">gnuplot</a>
       program,
  <li> <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> (the version should
       be at least 1.5), and
  <li> the <a href="http://xfiles.llnl.gov/python.htm"> Numeric Python
       extension</a>
</ul>

If you want to run under MS Windows, make sure you have the <a
href="http://www.python.org/download/download_windows.html">Win32
extensions</a> installed.  Also make sure you have
<tt>pgnuplot.exe</tt> (see the <a href="README"> README file</a> for
details).

<p> To install Gnuplot.py:
<ol>
  <li> Download either <a href="Gnuplot-1.4.tar.gz">
       Gnuplot-1.4.tar.gz</a> or <a href="Gnuplot-1.4.zip">
       Gnuplot-1.4.zip</a>.
  <li> Gunzip and untar (or unzip) it, which will create a directory
       called ``Gnuplot-1.4''.
  <li> Refer to the <a href="README"> README</a> file in that
       directory for further instructions.
</ol>

<h2>Credits</h2>

The Gnuplot.py package was written by <a
href="http://monsoon.harvard.edu/~mhagger/">Michael Haggerty</a>.

<p> The package was inspired by and partly derived from the Gnuplot.py
module written by <a href="http://starship.skyport.net/crew/hinsen/">
Konrad Hinsen</a>.  The <tt>oldplot.py</tt> module is roughly
backwards compatible with Konrad's version.

<p> Berthold H&ouml;llman helped get me started with the <a
href="http://starship.skyport.net/crew/danilo/pythondoc/pythondoc.htm">
pythondoc</a> package.

<p> Craig Schardt and Francois Ladouceur contributed changes that
enable Gnuplot.py to work under MS-Windows.  Tony Ingraldi contributed
changes for the Macintosh.
