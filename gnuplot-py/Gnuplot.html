<h2>Intro</h2>

<a href="Gnuplot.tar.gz">Gnuplot.py</a> is a Python module that
interfaces to <a
href="ftp://ftp.gnuplot.vt.edu/pub/gnuplot/faq/index.html">gnuplot</a>,
the popular plotting program.  It allows you to use gnuplot from
within Python to plot arrays of data from memory, data files, or
mathematical functions.  If you use Python to perform computations or
as `glue' for numerical programs, you can use this module to plot data
on the fly as they are computed.  And the combination with Python
makes it is easy to automate things, including to create crude
`animations' by plotting different datasets one after another.

<p> Commands are communicated to gnuplot through a pipe and data
either through the same pipe (as "inline" data) or through temporary
files.  It has been written and tested on a unix computer but should
also work under MS Windows and possibly other operating systems
(please give me feedback!)

<p> This module has an object-oriented design that allows the user
flexibility to set plot options and to run multiple gnuplot sessions
simultaneously.  If you are more ambitious, it is not difficult to add
entirely new types of plottable items by deriving from the `PlotItem'
class.

<p> For a demonstration, run the python file by typing `python
Gnuplot.py'.

<h2>News</h2>

<a href="Gnuplot-1.2.tar.gz">Version 1.2</a> has been released and is
now the current version (8 Aug 1999).  This version adds the following
features:

<ul>
  <li> Support for MS Windows, using the `pgnuplot.exe' program.
       Thanks go especially to Craig Schardt for help with this.
  <li> Support for using binary files to send grid data to splot.
       This saves a lot of time and usually saves space compared with
       the old text files.  (Only works with recent versions of
       gnuplot.)
  <li> Support for sending data to gnuplot as `inline data'
       (i.e., "plot '-'").  This method should be faster than the
       alternate method, temporary files.  (Only works with recent
       versions of gnuplot.)
  <li> Allows PlotItem options to be modified after the PlotItem is
       constructed.
  <li> Simplified the PlotItem inheritance hierarchy (Data and
       GridData are no longer derived from File).
  <li> Added several configuration options (see top of Gnuplot.py).
  <li> Separated function-based interface into a separate file
       (Gnuplot_plot.py).
  <li> Added a test module, Gnuplot_test.py, which tests most of the
       features of Gnuplot.py.
  <li> A README file, lots of documentation changes, etc.
</ul>

<p> <a href="Gnuplot-1.1a.tar.gz">Version 1.1a</a> has been released (9
Apr 1999).  This version just addresses a couple of minor portability
issues.

<p> <a href="Gnuplot-1.1.tar.gz">Version 1.1</a> has been released (31
Jan 1999).  New features:

<ul>
  <li> 3-D plots are now supported through the new `splot' method:
       <ul>
	 <li> To create a scatter plot, pass splot a 2-D array
	      containing (x,y,z) triplets;
	 <li> To create a grid plot, pass a 3-D array consisting of a
	      2-D array of (x,y,z) triplets; or
	 <li> Use the new `GridData' PlotItem to plot gridded data
	      (data tabulated on a rectangular grid).
       </ul>
  <li> It is now easier to pass data to gnuplot.  The `Data' PlotItem
       now accepts multiple arguments representing subsequent
       `columns' of the dataset; e.g., what used to be written as
       <pre>
          g = Gnuplot.Gnuplot()
          x = Numeric.arange(100)/10.0
          y = x**2
          # Create an array of (x,y) pairs:
          g.plot(Gnuplot.Data(Numeric.transpose((x, y))))
       </pre>
       can now be shortened to
       <pre>
          # Plot y vs. x directly:
          g.plot(Gnuplot.Data(x, y))
       </pre>
       (both examples plot x squared vs. x).  Similarly, splot can be
       passed three arrays representing the values of x, y, and z.
       Note that the old interpretation is still used if a single
       argument is passed to `Data'.
</ul>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

The quickest way to learn how to use Gnuplot.py is to run the simple
demonstration by typing `python Gnuplot.py', then to look at the
bottom of the Gnuplot.py file to see the commands that create the
demo.  One of the examples is probably similar to what you want to do.

<p> Thanks to <a
href="http://starship.skyport.net/crew/danilo/pythondoc/">
pythondoc</a>, there is now some <a href="Gnuplot-doc/"> online
documentation</a> for Gnuplot.py, extracted from the module's
docstrings.  Alternatively, you can look at the docstrings in
Gnuplot.py yourself by opening the file in an editor.

<p> To get good use out of Gnuplot.py, you will want to know something
about gnuplot, for which a good source is the gnuplot help (run
gnuplot then type `help', or read it online at <a
href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/gnuplot/gnuplot.html"> this
website</a>).  You might also want to check out Bernhard Reiter's <a
href="http://www.usf.Uni-Osnabrueck.DE/~breiter/tools/gnuplot/index.en.html">
gnuplot information page</a>, which has many more links.

<h2>Installation</h2>

More detailed installation instructions are contained in the <a
href="README"> README file</a>.

Before you can use Gnuplot.py, you will need working versions of
<ul>
  <li> the <a
       href="ftp://ftp.gnuplot.vt.edu/pub/gnuplot/">gnuplot</a>
       program,
  <li> <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>, and
  <li> the <a href="http://xfiles.llnl.gov/python.htm"> Numeric Python
       extension</a>
</ul>
If you want to run under MS Windows, you will also need pgnuplot.exe
(see the README file for details).

To install Gnuplot.py:
<ol>
  <li> Download either <a href="Gnuplot.tar.gz"> Gnuplot.tar.gz</a>
       or <a href="Gnuplot.zip"> Gnuplot.zip</a> (these are symlinks
       to the most recent version).
  <li> Gunzip and untar (or unzip) it, which will create a directory
       called ``Gnuplot-<i>version</i>'' where <i>version</i> is the
       current Gnuplot.py version.
  <li> Refer to the <a href="README"> README</a> file in that
       directory for further instructions.
</ol>

<h2>Credits</h2>

The Gnuplot.py module was written by <a
href="http://monsoon.harvard.edu/~mhagger/">Michael Haggerty</a>.

<p> The module was inspired by and partly derived from the Gnuplot.py
module written by <a href="http://starship.skyport.net/crew/hinsen/">
Konrad Hinsen</a>.  There is a `plot' function in the Gnuplot_plot.py
module that is roughly backwards compatible with the function in
Konrad's version.

<p> Berthold H&ouml;llman introduced me to the helpful <a
href="http://starship.skyport.net/crew/danilo/pythondoc/pythondoc.htm">
pythondoc</a> package, and contributed some docstring changes to help
it create attractive web documentation from the Gnuplot.py source.

<p> Craig Schardt and Francois Ladouceur contributed changes that
enable Gnuplot.py to work under MS-Windows.
