<h2>Intro</h2>

Gnuplot.py is a Python package that interfaces to <a
href="http://www.gnuplot.org/">gnuplot</a>, the popular open-source
plotting program.  It allows you to use gnuplot from within Python to
plot arrays of data from memory, data files, or mathematical
functions.  If you use Python to perform computations or as `glue' for
numerical programs, you can use this package to plot data on the fly
as they are computed.  And the combination with Python makes it is
easy to automate things, including to create crude `animations' by
plotting different datasets one after another. </p>

<p> Commands are communicated to gnuplot through a pipe and data
either through the same pipe (as "inline" data) or through temporary
files.  It has been written and tested on a unix computer but is also
reported to work on MS Windows and the Macintosh (please give me
feedback!) </p>

<p> This package has an object-oriented design that allows the user
flexibility to set plot options and to run multiple gnuplot sessions
simultaneously.  If you are more ambitious, it is not difficult to add
entirely new types of plottable items by deriving from the
`<tt>PlotItem</tt>' class. </p>

<p> The package includes a demonstration that can be run by typing
`<tt>python demo.py</tt>'. </p>


<h2>News</h2>

<p> (7 Jan 2001) The development of Gnuplot.py went through a lull
during year 2000.  The main reason is that I've changed jobs and
haven't been using Gnuplot.py, nor had much time to work on it.
Another reason (I like to think) is that it works pretty well now and
hasn't needed much work.  Nevertheless, several contributions from
other users have accumulated and I'm working to incorporate them into
the source.  At the same time, I am moving the project to <a
href="http://sourceforge.net">SourceForge</a> because of their
excellent facilities and to open up the development process.  The
result should be a version 1.5 "real soon now" with a few minor new
features, a better source code organization, a <a
href="http://python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/">distutils</a>-based
installation process, and better platform independence. </p>

<p> Version 1.4 was released some time ago (11 Oct 1999).  This
version included the following changes:

<ul>
<li> Added support for the Macintosh.
<li> Separated the platform-dependent code into separate modules:
     <tt>gp.py</tt>, <tt>gp_mac.py</tt>, and <tt>gp_win32.py</tt>.
<li> Allow access to all of the postscript printer driver options
     through the <tt>hardcopy()</tt> command.
<li> Fixed an import problem in <tt>test.py</tt>.
</ul> </p>

<p> Version 1.3 (released 23 Sep 1999) introduced the following
features:

<ul>
<li> Converted to package format.  The main file is now called
     <tt>__init__.py</tt>, so that it can be loaded by typing
     `<tt>import Gnuplot</tt>'.
<li> Passing a callable function to <tt>GridData</tt> was broken; that
     functionality is now provided by a new type of <tt>PlotItem</tt>
     called `<tt>GridFunc</tt>'.
<li> Added a new keyword argument, `<tt>ufunc</tt>', to
     <tt>grid_function</tt> and to <tt>GridFunc</tt>, to request that
     the function be evaluated matrix-wise.
<li> Separated the demonstration code into a separate file,
     <tt>demo.py</tt>, and added a <tt>test.py</tt> module to test the
     features of <tt>Gnuplot.py</tt>.
</ul> </p>

<p> To read about changes introduced in earlier versions, read the
<tt>NEWS.txt</tt> file in the distribution. </p>


<h2>Documentation</h2>

The quickest way to learn how to use Gnuplot.py is to run the simple
demonstration by typing `<tt>python demo.py</tt>', then to look at the
<tt>demo.py</tt> file to see the commands that create the demo.  One
of the examples is probably similar to what you want to do. </p>

<p> There is also <a
href="http://monsoon.harvard.edu/~mhagger/Gnuplot/Gnuplot-doc/">
online documentation</a> for Gnuplot.py, extracted automatically from
the package's docstrings using <a
href="http://starship.python.net/crew/danilo/pythondoc/">
pythondoc</a>.  Or you can download the html documentation to your
machine in <a
href="http://download.sourceforge.net/gnuplot-py/Gnuplot-doc-1.4.tar.gz">
tar</a> or <a
href="http://download.sourceforge.net/gnuplot-py/Gnuplot-doc-1.4.zip">
zip</a> format. </p>

<p> Finally, you can look at the docstrings yourself by opening the
file <tt>__init__.py</tt> in an editor. </p>

<p> To get good use out of Gnuplot.py, you will want to know something
about gnuplot, for which a good source is the gnuplot help (run
gnuplot then type `help', or read it online at <a
href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/gnuplot/gnuplot.html"> this
website</a>).  You might also want to check out Bernhard Reiter's <a
href="http://www.usf.Uni-Osnabrueck.DE/~breiter/tools/gnuplot/index.en.html">
gnuplot information page</a>, which has many more links. </p>


<h2>Installation</h2>

<p> More detailed installation instructions are contained in
<tt>README.txt</tt></a>. </p>

<p> Before you can use Gnuplot.py, you will need working versions of
<ul>
  <li> the <a href="http://www.gnuplot.org">gnuplot</a> program,
  <li> <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> (version 1.5 or
       later), and
  <li> the <a href="http://numpy.sourceforge.net/"> Numeric Python
       extension</a>
</ul> </p>

<p> If you want to run under MS Windows, make sure you are either
using Python version 2.0 or later or that you have the <a
href="http://www.python.org/download/download_windows.html">Win32
extensions</a> installed.  Also make sure you have
<tt>pgnuplot.exe</tt> (see the README.txt file for details). </p>

<p> To install Gnuplot.py:
<ol>
  <li> Download either <a
       href="http://download.sourceforge.net/gnuplot-py/Gnuplot-1.4.tar.gz">
       Gnuplot-1.4.tar.gz</a> or <a
       href="http://download.sourceforge.net/gnuplot-py/Gnuplot-1.4.zip">
       Gnuplot-1.4.zip</a>.
  <li> Gunzip and untar (or unzip) it, which will create a directory
       called ``Gnuplot-1.4''.
  <li> Refer to <tt>README.txt</tt> in that directory for further
       instructions.  Basically it should be enough to type
       <code>python setup.py install</code>.
</ol> </p>

<p> You can also access the latest Gnuplot.py sources via CVS.  Click

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p> The Gnuplot.py package was written by <a
href="http://monsoon.harvard.edu/~mhagger/">Michael Haggerty</a>. </p>

<p> The package was inspired by and partly derived from the Gnuplot.py
module written by <a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/hinsen/">
Konrad Hinsen</a>.  The <tt>oldplot.py</tt> module is roughly
backwards compatible with Konrad's version. </p>

<p> Berthold H&ouml;llmann helped get me started with the <a
href="http://starship.skyport.net/crew/danilo/pythondoc/pythondoc.htm">
pythondoc</a> package and submitted a <tt>setup.py</tt> file to be
used with <tt>distutils</tt>. </p>

<p> Craig Schardt and Francois Ladouceur contributed changes that
enable Gnuplot.py to work under MS-Windows.  Tony Ingraldi contributed
changes for the Macintosh. </p>

<p> Jannie Hofmeyr submitted a fix for Windows under Python 2.0. </p>
