CREDITS:

Gnuplot.py was written by Michael Haggerty
<mhagger@blizzard.harvard.edu>, inspired by and partly derived from an
earlier version by Konrad Hinsen.  I maintain it and continue to
develop it, though by now it has most of the features that I had
planned for it.

Any errors in Gnuplot.py are mine; however, I would like to
acknowledge and express my appreciation to the following people for
their contributions:

Konrad Hinsen <hinsen@ibs.ibs.fr> wrote the first, procedural
interface version of Gnuplot.py.  His code is still present in many
components of the current version, and the oldplot.py module is meant
to be (mostly) backwards compatible with his version.

Berthold Hoellmann <se6y095@public.uni-hamburg.de> introduced me to
the helpful package `pythondoc', and contributed some docstring
changes to allow web documentation to be generated from the Gnuplot.py
source.

Craig Schardt <lazrnerd@ufl.edu> and Francois Ladouceur
<f.ladouceur@virtualphotonics.com> contributed changes that enable
Gnuplot.py to work under MS-Windows.

Tony Ingraldi <a.m.ingraldi@larc.nasa.gov> got Gnuplot.py to work on
the Macintosh.  In particular, the gnuplot_Suites.py file was
contributed by him, as were several changes to the other files.
