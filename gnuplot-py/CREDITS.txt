CREDITS:

Gnuplot.py was written by Michael Haggerty
<mhagger@blizzard.harvard.edu>, inspired by and partly derived from an
earlier version by Konrad Hinsen.  I maintain it and continue to
develop it, though with the release of version 1.2 it has most of the
features that I had planned for it.

Any errors in Gnuplot.py are mine; however, I would like to
acknowledge and express my appreciation to the following people for
their contributions:

Konrad Hinsen <hinsen@ibs.ibs.fr> wrote the first, procedural
interface version of Gnuplot.py.  His code is still present in many
components of the current version, and the Gnuplot_plot.py module is
meant to be (mostly) backwards compatible with his version.

Berthold Hoellmann <se6y095@public.uni-hamburg.de> introduced me to
the helpful package `pythondoc', and contributed some docstring
changes to allow web documentation to be generated from the Gnuplot.py
source.

Craig Schardt <lazrnerd@ufl.edu> and Francois Ladouceur
<f.ladouceur@virtualphotonics.com> contributed changes that enable
Gnuplot.py to work under MS-Windows.
