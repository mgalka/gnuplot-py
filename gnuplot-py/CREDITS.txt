CREDITS:

Gnuplot.py was written by Michael Haggerty <mhagger@alum.mit.edu>,
inspired by and partly derived from an earlier version by Konrad
Hinsen.  I maintain it and continue to develop it, though by now it
has most of the features that I had planned for it.

I would like to acknowledge and express my appreciation to the
following people for their contributions:

Konrad Hinsen <hinsen@ibs.ibs.fr> wrote the first, procedural
interface version of Gnuplot.py.  His code is still present in many
components of the current version, and the oldplot.py module is meant
to be (mostly) backwards compatible with his version.

Berthold Hoellmann <se6y095@public.uni-hamburg.de> introduced me to
the helpful package `pythondoc', and contributed some docstring
changes to allow web documentation to be generated from the Gnuplot.py
source.

Craig Schardt <lazrnerd@ufl.edu> and Francois Ladouceur
<f.ladouceur@virtualphotonics.com> contributed changes to enable
Gnuplot.py to work under MS-Windows.

Tony Ingraldi <a.m.ingraldi@larc.nasa.gov> got Gnuplot.py to work on
the Macintosh and Noburu Yamamoto also contributed to this code.

Stuard Reynolds <S.I.Reynolds@cs.bham.ac.uk> made some helpful
suggestions for automating the tabulation of function values.
