This file imports a low-level, platform-independent interface to the
gnuplot program.  Which interface is imported depends on the platform.
There are variations of this file for Unix, the Macintosh, and for
Windows called gp_unix.py, gp_mac.py, and gp_win32.py, respectively.
Note that the end-user should use the more capable interface from
__init__.py (i.e., import Gnuplot) rather than the low-level interface
defined in this file.

See gp_unix.py for most documentation about the facilities of the
gp_*.py modules.
