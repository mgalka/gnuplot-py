"""Gnuplot_plot.py -- Obsolete functional version of Gnuplot.py.

This module implements a function 'plot' that can be used to plot
array data through the gnuplot program.  It is provided for backwards
compatibility with Konrad Hinsen's old module.  The new
object-oriented interface defined in Gnuplot.py has far more features
and should be used for new work.

    This command is roughly compatible with old Gnuplot plot command.
    It is provided for backwards compatibility with the old functional
    interface only.  It is recommended that you use the new
    object-oriented Gnuplot interface, which is much more flexible.

    It can only plot Numeric array data.  In this routine an NxM array
    is plotted as M-1 separate datasets, using columns 1:2, 1:3, ...,

    Limitations:

        - If persist is not available, the temporary files are not
          deleted until final python cleanup.
