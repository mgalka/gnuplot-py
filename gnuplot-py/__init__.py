# A more complicated gnuplot interface.

# Written by Michael Haggerty <mhagger@blizzard.harvard.edu>
# Derived from earlier version by Konrad Hinsen <hinsen@ibs.ibs.fr>

# New features:
#  +  A gnuplot session is an instance of class `gnuplot', so multiple
#     sessions can be open at once:
#         g1 = gnuplot(); g2 = gnuplot()
#  +  The implicitly-generated gnuplot commands can be stored to a file
#     instead of executed immediately:
#         g = gnuplot("commands.gnuplot")
#  +  Can pass arbitrary commands to the gnuplot command interpreter:
#         g("set pointsize 2")
#  +  A gnuplot object knows how to plot three types of `plotitem':
#     `data', `file', and `func'tion.
#  +  Any plotitem can have optional `title' and/or `with' suboptions
#  +  Builtin plotitem types:
#      *  data(array1) -- data from a Python list or NumPy array
#         (option: `cols')
#      *  file("filename") -- data from an existing data file (option:
#         `using')
#      *  func("exp(4.0 * sin(x))") -- functions (passed as a string
#         for gnuplot to evaluate)
#  +  Communication of data between python and gnuplot is via
#     temporary files, which are deleted automatically when their
#     associated plotitem is deleted.
#  +  Plotitems can be created as objects that are kept around and
#     plotted multiple times---temporary files need only be written
#     once.
#  +  Can use `replot' method to add datasets to an existing plot.
#  +  Can make persistent gnuplot windows by using the constructor
#     option `persist=1'.  (`persist' is no longer the default.)
#
# Restrictions:
#  -  Relies on the Numeric Python extension.  This can be obtained
#     from LLNL (See ftp://ftp-icf.llnl.gov/pub/python/README.html).
#  -  Only 2-d plots are supported so far.
#  -  There is no provision for missing data points in array data
#     (which gnuplot would allow by specifying `?' as a data point).
#     I can't think of a clean way to implement this since NumPy
#     doesn't have provisions for NaN.
#  -  Plotting to a postscript file is via new `hardcopy' method
#     instead of a option on the `plot' method as in the older
#     version of gnuplot.
#  -  Doesn't automatically plot using 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, etc for
#     multi-columned data as did the old version of gnuplot.  Instead
#     make a temporary data file then plot that file multiple times
#     with different `using=' options:
#         a = temparrayfile(array_nx3)
#         g.plot(file(a, using=(1,2)), file(a, using=(1,3)))
#  -  There is no supported way to change the plotting options of
#     plotitems after they have been created.
#
# Bugs:
#  -  No attempt is made to check for errors reported by gnuplot (but
#     they will appear on stderr).
#  -  Does not check whether persistent windows are really supported
#     by the version of gnuplot used.  Only ask for persistent windows
#     if your gnuplot accepts the `-persist' flag!
#  -  All of these classes perform their resource deallocation when
#     __del__ is called.  If you delete things explicitly, there is no
#     problem.  If you don't, an attempt is made to delete remaining
#     objects when the interpreter is exited, but this is not
#     completely reliable, so sometimes temporary files will be left
#     around.
