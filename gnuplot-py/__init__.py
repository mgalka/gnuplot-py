"""Gnuplot -- A pipe-based interface to the gnuplot plotting program.

This is the main module of the Gnuplot package.

by and partly derived from an earlier version by Konrad Hinsen
<hinsen@ibs.ibs.fr>.  If you find a problem or have a suggestion,
please let me know at <mhagger@blizzard.harvard.edu>.  Other feedback
would also be appreciated.

For information about how to use this module:

1.  Check the README file.
2.  Look at the test code in demo.py and try running it by typing
    'python demo.py' or 'python __init__.py'.
3a. For more details see the extensive documentation strings
    throughout this file.
3b. The docstrings have also been turned into html which can be read
    at <http://monsoon.harvard.edu/~mhagger/Gnuplot/Gnuplot-doc/>.
    However, the formatting is not perfect; when in doubt,
    double-check the docstrings.

You should import this file with 'import Gnuplot', not with 'from
Gnuplot import *', because the module and the main class have the same
name, `Gnuplot'.

To obtain the gnuplot plotting program itself, see
<ftp://ftp.gnuplot.vt.edu/pub/gnuplot/faq/index.html>.  Obviously you
need to have gnuplot installed if you want to use Gnuplot.py.

The old command-based interface to gnuplot has been separated out into
a separate module, oldplot.py.  If you are still using that interface
you should import Gnuplot.oldplot; otherwise you should stick to the
more flexible object-oriented interface contained here.

Features:

 o  Allows the creation of two or three dimensional plots from
    python.

 o  A gnuplot session is an instance of class 'Gnuplot'.  Multiple
    sessions can be open at once.

    Example:

        g1 = Gnuplot.Gnuplot()
        g2 = Gnuplot.Gnuplot()

    Note that due to a limitation in pgnuplot, opening multiple
    simultaneous sessions under Windows may not work correctly.

 o  The implicitly-generated gnuplot commands can be stored to a file
    instead of executed immediately.

    Example:

        g = Gnuplot.Gnuplot('commands.gnuplot')

    The file can then be run later with gnuplot's 'load' command.
    Beware, however: if the plot commands depend on the existence of
    temporary files, they will probably be deleted before you use the
    command file.

 o  Can pass arbitrary commands to the gnuplot command interpreter.

    Example:

        g('set pointsize 2')

 o  A Gnuplot object knows how to plot objects of type 'PlotItem'.
    Any PlotItem can have optional 'title' and/or 'with' suboptions.
    Builtin PlotItem types:
        
    * 'Data(array1)' -- data from a Python list or NumPy array
                        (permits additional option 'cols' )

    * 'File('filename')' -- data from an existing data file (permits
                            additional option 'using' )

    * 'Func('exp(4.0 * sin(x))')' -- functions (passed as a string,
                                     evaluated by gnuplot)

    * 'GridData(m, x, y)' -- data tabulated on a grid of (x,y) values
                             (usually to be plotted in 3-D)

    * 'GridFunc(f, xvals, yvals)' -- a function f which is to be
                                     tabulated on a grid of (x,y) pairs.

    See the documentation strings for those classes for more details.

 o  PlotItems are implemented as objects that can be assigned to
    variables and plotted repeatedly.  Most of their plot options can
    also be changed with the new 'set_option()' member functions then
    they can be replotted with their new options.

 o  Communication of commands to gnuplot is via a one-way pipe.
    Communication of data from python to gnuplot is via inline data
    (through the command pipe) or via temporary files.  Temp files are
    deleted automatically when their associated 'PlotItem' is deleted.
    The PlotItems in use by a Gnuplot object at any given time are
    stored in an internal list so that they won't be deleted
    prematurely.

 o  Can use 'replot' method to add datasets to an existing plot.

 o  Can make persistent gnuplot windows by using the constructor option
    'persist=1'.  Such windows stay around even after the gnuplot
    program is exited.  Note that only newer version of gnuplot support
    this option.

 o  Can plot either directly to a postscript printer or to a
    postscript file via the 'hardcopy' method.

 o  Grid data for the splot command can be sent to gnuplot in binary
    format, saving time and disk space.

 o  Should work under either unix or Windows.

Restrictions:
    
 -  Relies on the Numeric Python extension.  This can be obtained
    from LLNL (See ftp://ftp-icf.llnl.gov/pub/python/README.html).
    If you're interested in gnuplot, you would probably also want
    NumPy anyway.

 -  Only a small fraction of gnuplot functionality is implemented as
    explicit method functions.  However, you can give arbitrary
    commands to gnuplot manually.

    Example:

        g = Gnuplot.Gnuplot()
        g('set data style linespoints')
        g('set pointsize 5')

    I might add a more organized way of setting arbitrary options, but
    there doesn't seem to be a pressing need for it.

 -  There is no provision for missing data points in array data (which
    gnuplot would allow by specifying '?' as a data point).  I'm
    thinking about implementing this as an optional 'mask' argument to
    the Data PlotItem.  (Comments?)

Bugs:

 -  No attempt is made to check for errors reported by gnuplot.  On
    unix any gnuplot error messages simply appear on stderr.  (I don't
    know what happens under Windows.)

 -  All of these classes perform their resource deallocation when
    '__del__' is called.  Normally this works fine, but there are
    well-known cases when Python's automatic resource deallocation
    fails, which can leave temporary files around.

# handy but unfortunately it is not supported by older versions of
# gnuplot.  The following configuration variable specifies whether the
# user's version of gnuplot recognizes this option or not.  You can
# set this variable to 1 (supports -persist) or 0 (doesn't support)

# space and therefore it is the default for that type of plot.  But if
# you have an older version of gnuplot (or you prefer text format) you
# can disable the binary option in either of two ways: (a) set the

    'debug' -- if this flag is set, commands sent to gnuplot will also
               be echoed to stderr.
    'plotcmd' -- 'plot' or 'splot', depending on what was the last
                 plot command.

    Methods:

    '__init__' -- if a filename argument is specified, the commands
                  will be written to that file instead of being piped
                  to gnuplot.
    'plot' -- clear the old plot and old PlotItems, then plot the
              arguments in a fresh plot command.  Arguments can be: a
              PlotItem, which is plotted along with its internal
              options; a string, which is plotted as a Func; or
              anything else, which is plotted as a Data.
    'splot' -- like 'plot', except for 3-d plots.
    'hardcopy' -- replot the plot to a postscript file (if filename
                  argument is specified) or pipe it to the printer as
                  postscript othewise.  If the option `color' is set
                  to true, then output color postscript.
    'replot' -- replot the old items, adding any arguments as
                additional items as in the plot method.
    'refresh' -- issue (or reissue) the plot command using the current
                 PlotItems.
    '__call__' -- pass an arbitrary string to the gnuplot process,
