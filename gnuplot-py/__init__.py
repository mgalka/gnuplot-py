# A more complicated gnuplot interface.

# Written by Michael Haggerty <mhagger@blizzard.harvard.edu>
# Derived from earlier version by Konrad Hinsen <hinsen@ibs.ibs.fr>

# New features:
#  +  A gnuplot session is an instance of class `gnuplot', so multiple
#     sessions can be open at once:
#         g = gnuplot()
#  +  The implicitly-generated gnuplot commands can be stored to a file
#     instead of executed immediately:
#         g = gnuplot("commands.gnuplot")
#  +  Can pass arbitrary commands to the gnuplot command interpreter:
#         g("set pointsize 2")
#  +  A gnuplot object knows how to plot three types of `plotitem':
#     `data', `file', and `func'tion.
#  +  Any plotitem can have optional `title' and/or `with' suboptions
#  +  Builtin plotitem types:
#      *  data(array1) -- data from a Python list or NumPy array
#         (option: `cols')
#      *  file("filename") -- data from an existing data file (option:
#         `using')
#      *  func("exp(4.0 * sin(x))") -- functions (passed as a string
#         for gnuplot to evaluate)
#  +  Communication of data between python and gnuplot is via
#     temporary files, which are deleted automatically when their
#     associated plotitem is deleted.
#  +  Plotitems can be created as objects that are kept around and
#     plotted multiple times---temporary files need only be written
#     once.
#  +  Can use `replot' method to add traces to an existing plot.
#  +  Can make persistent gnuplot windows by using the constructor
#     option `persist=1'.

# Restrictions:
#  -  Only 2-d plots are supported
#  -  There is no provision for missing data points in array data
#  -  Does not check whether persistent windows are really supported
#     by the version of gnuplot used (but persistent windows are
#     anyway not the default).
#  -  Plotting to a postscript file is via new `hardcopy' method
#     instead of a option on the `plot' method as in the older
#     version.
#  -  Doesn't automatically plot using 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, etc for
#     multi-columned data as did the old version.  Instead make a
#     temporary data file then plot that file multiple times with
#     different `using=' options:
#         a = temparrayfile(array_nx3)
#         g.plot(file(a, using=(1,2)), file(a, using=(1,3)))
#  -  All of these classes perform their resource deallocation when
#     __del__ is called.  I understand this is not completely
#     reliable, so it is possible that temporary files will be left
#     around.
#  -  There is no way to change the plotting options of plotitems
#     after they are created.

# plotitem represents an item that can be plotted by gnuplot.  For the

#     options -- a list of strings that need to be passed as options
#                to the plot command (in the order required); e.g.,
#                ['title "data"', 'with linespoints'].
#     title -- the title requested (undefined if not requested).  Note
#              that `title=None' implies the `notitle' option, whereas
#              omitting the title option implies no option (the
#              gnuplot default is then used).

# gnuplot plotting object.  A gnuplot represents a running gnuplot
# process and a pipe to communicate with it.  It keeps a reference to
# each of the plotitems used in the current plot, so that they (and
# their associated temporary files) are not deleted prematurely.
# Members:
#     gnuplot -- the pipe to gnuplot or a file gathering the commands
#     itemlist -- a list of the plotitems that are associated with the
#                 current plot.  These are deleted whenever a new plot
#                 command is issued via the `plot' method.
# Methods:
#     __init__ -- if a filename argument is specified, the commands
#                 will be written to that file instead of being piped
#                 to gnuplot immediately.
#     __call__ -- pass an arbitrary string to the gnuplot process,
#                 followed by a newline.
#     refresh -- issue (or reissue) the plot command using the current
#                plotitems.
#     plot -- clear the old plot and old plotitems, then plot its
#             arguments in a fresh plot command.  Arguments can be: a
#             plotitem, which is plotted along with its internal
#             options; a string, which is plotted as a func(); or
#             anything else, which is plotted as a data().
#     replot -- replot the old items, adding any arguments as
#               additional items as in the plot method.
#     interact -- read lines from stdin and send them, one by one, to
#                 the gnuplot interpreter.  Basically you can type
#                 commands directly to the gnuplot command processor
#                 (though without command-line editing).
#     load -- load a file (using the gnuplot `load' command).
#     save -- save gnuplot commands to a file (using gnuplot `save'
#             command, not the saved plotitems).
#     xlabel,ylabel --  set xlabel or ylabel to be a string.
#     hardcopy -- replot the plot to a postscript file (if filename
#                 argument is specified) or pipe it to lpr othewise.
#                 If the option `color' is set to true, then output
#                 color postscript.
