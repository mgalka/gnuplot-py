# For information about how to use this module, see the comments
# below, the documentation string for class Gnuplot, and the test code
# at the bottom of the file.  You can run the test code by typing
# `python Gnuplot.py'.

# You should import this file with `import Gnuplot', not with `from
# Gnuplot import *'; otherwise you will have problems with conflicting
# names (specifically, the Gnuplot module name conflicts with the
# Gnuplot class name).  To obtain gnuplot itself, see
# <http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/gnuplot_info.html>.

# Features:
#  +  A gnuplot session is an instance of class `Gnuplot', so multiple
#     sessions can be open at once:
#         g1 = Gnuplot.Gnuplot(); g2 = Gnuplot.Gnuplot()
#  +  The implicitly-generated gnuplot commands can be stored to a file
#     instead of executed immediately:
#         g = Gnuplot.Gnuplot("commands.gnuplot")
#     The file can then be run later with gnuplot's `load' command.
#     Note, however, that this option does not cause the life of any
#     temporary data files to be extended.
#  +  Can pass arbitrary commands to the gnuplot command interpreter:
#         g("set pointsize 2")
#  +  A Gnuplot object knows how to plot objects of type `PlotItem'.
#     Any PlotItem can have optional `title' and/or `with' suboptions.
#     Builtin PlotItem types:
#      *  Data(array1) -- data from a Python list or NumPy array
#         (permits additional option `cols')
#      *  File("filename") -- data from an existing data file (permits
#         additional option `using')
#      *  Func("exp(4.0 * sin(x))") -- functions (passed as a string
#         for gnuplot to evaluate)
#     See those classes for more details.
#  +  PlotItems are implemented as objects that can be assigned to
#     variables (including their options) and plotted
#     repeatedly---this also saves much of the overhead of plotting
#     the same data multiple times.
#  +  Communication of data between python and gnuplot is via
#     temporary files, which are deleted automatically when their
#     associated PlotItem is deleted.  (Communication of commands is
#     via a pipe.)  The PlotItems currently in use by a Gnuplot object
#     are stored in an internal list so that they won't be deleted
#     prematurely.
#  +  Can use `replot' method to add datasets to an existing plot.
#  +  Can make persistent gnuplot windows by using the constructor
#     option `persist=1'.  (`persist' is no longer the default.)  Such
#     windows stay around even after the gnuplot program is exited.
#     Note that only newer version of gnuplot support this option.
#  +  Plotting to a postscript file is via new `hardcopy' method,
#     which outputs the currently-displayed plot to either a
#     postscript printer or to a postscript file.
#  +  There is a `plot' command which is roughly compatible with the
#     command from the old Gnuplot.py.
#
# Restrictions:
#  -  Relies on the Numeric Python extension.  This can be obtained
#     from LLNL (See ftp://ftp-icf.llnl.gov/pub/python/README.html).
#     If you're interested in gnuplot, you would probably also want
#     NumPy anyway.
#  -  Probably depends on a unix-type environment.  Anyone who wants
#     to remedy this situation should get in contact with me.
#  -  Only a small fraction of gnuplot functionality is implemented as
#     explicit Gnuplot method functions.  However, you can give
#     arbitrary commands to gnuplot manually; for example:
#         g = Gnuplot.Gnuplot()
#         g('set data style linespoints')
#         g('set pointsize 5')
#     etc.  I might add a more organized way of setting arbitrary
#     options.
#  -  Only 2-d plots are supported so far.
#  -  There is no provision for missing data points in array data
#     (which gnuplot would allow by specifying `?' as a data point).
#     I can't think of a clean way to implement this; maybe one could
#     use NaN for machines that support IEEE floating point.
#  -  There is no supported way to change the plotting options of
#     PlotItems after they have been created.
#  -  The object-oriented interface doesn't automatically plot
#     datasets column-by-column using 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, etc as did the
#     old version of Gnuplot.py.  Instead, make a temporary data file
#     then plot that file multiple times with different `using='
#     options:
#         a = Gnuplot.TemparrayFile(array_nx3)
#         g.plot(Gnuplot.File(a, using=(1,2)), Gnuplot.File(a, using=(1,3)))
#  -  Does not support parallel axis plots, as did the old Gnuplot.py.
#
# Bugs:
#  -  No attempt is made to check for errors reported by gnuplot (but
#     they will appear on stderr).
#  -  All of these classes perform their resource deallocation when
#     __del__ is called.  If you delete things explicitly, there will
#     be no problem.  If you don't, an attempt is made to delete
#     remaining objects when the interpreter is exited, but this is
#     not completely reliable, so sometimes temporary files will be
#     left around.  If anybody knows how to fix this problem, please
#     let me know.

    associated temporary files) are not deleted prematurely.  The
    communication is one-way; gnuplot's text output just goes to
    stdout with no attempt to check it for error messages.

    Members:
        gnuplot -- the pipe to gnuplot or a file gathering the commands
        itemlist -- a list of the PlotItems that are associated with the
                    current plot.  These are deleted whenever a new plot
                    command is issued via the `plot' method.
        debug -- if this flag is set, commands sent to gnuplot will also
                 be echoed to stderr.
        plotcmd -- 'plot' or 'splot', depending on what was the last plot
                   command.

    Methods:
        __init__ -- if a filename argument is specified, the commands
                    will be written to that file instead of being piped

        plot -- clear the old plot and old PlotItems, then plot the
                arguments in a fresh plot command.  Arguments can be: a
                PlotItem, which is plotted along with its internal
                options; a string, which is plotted as a Func; or
                anything else, which is plotted as a Data.
        hardcopy -- replot the plot to a postscript file (if filename
                    argument is specified) or pipe it to lpr othewise.
                    If the option `color' is set to true, then output
                    color postscript.
        replot -- replot the old items, adding any arguments as
                  additional items as in the plot method.
        refresh -- issue (or reissue) the plot command using the current
                   PlotItems.
        __call__ -- pass an arbitrary string to the gnuplot process,
                    followed by a newline.
        xlabel,ylabel,title --  set attribute to be a string.
        interact -- read lines from stdin and send them, one by one, to
                    the gnuplot interpreter.  Basically you can type
                    commands directly to the gnuplot command processor
                    (though without command-line editing).
        load -- load a file (using the gnuplot `load' command).
        save -- save gnuplot commands to a file (using gnuplot `save'
                command) If any of the PlotItems is a temporary file,
                it will be deleted at the usual time and the save file
                might be pretty useless :-).
        clear -- clear the plot window (but not the itemlist).
        reset -- reset all gnuplot settings to their defaults and clear
                 the current itemlist.
