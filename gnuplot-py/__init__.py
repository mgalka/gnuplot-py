"""Gnuplot -- A pipe-based interface to the gnuplot plotting program.

by and partly derived from an earlier version by Konrad Hinsen
<hinsen@ibs.ibs.fr>.  If you find a problem or have a suggestion,
please let me know at <mhagger@blizzard.harvard.edu>.  Other feedback
would also be appreciated.

The Gnuplot.py home page is at

    <http://monsoon.harvard.edu/~mhagger/Gnuplot/Gnuplot.html>.


For information about how to use this module:

1.  Check the README file.
2.  Look at the example code in demo.py and try running it by typing
    'python demo.py' or 'python __init__.py'.
3a. For more details see the extensive documentation strings
    throughout this file and gp.py.
3b. The docstrings have also been turned into html which can be read
    at <http://monsoon.harvard.edu/~mhagger/Gnuplot/Gnuplot-doc/>.
    However, the formatting is not perfect; when in doubt,
    double-check the docstrings.

You should import this file with 'import Gnuplot', not with 'from
Gnuplot import *', because the module and the main class have the same
name, `Gnuplot'.

To obtain the gnuplot plotting program itself, see
<ftp://ftp.gnuplot.vt.edu/pub/gnuplot/faq/index.html>.  Obviously you
need to have gnuplot installed if you want to use Gnuplot.py.

The old command-based interface to gnuplot has been separated out into
a separate module, oldplot.py.  If you are still using that interface
you should import Gnuplot.oldplot; otherwise you should stick to the
more flexible object-oriented interface contained here.

Features:

 o  Allows the creation of two or three dimensional plots from
    python.

 o  A gnuplot session is an instance of class 'Gnuplot'.  Multiple
    sessions can be open at once.

    Example:

        g1 = Gnuplot.Gnuplot()
        g2 = Gnuplot.Gnuplot()

    Note that due to limitations on those platforms, opening multiple
    simultaneous sessions on Windows or Macintosh may not work
    correctly.  (Feedback?)

 o  The implicitly-generated gnuplot commands can be stored to a file
    instead of executed immediately.

    Example:

        g = Gnuplot.Gnuplot('commands.gnuplot')

    The file can then be run later with gnuplot's 'load' command.
    Beware, however: the plot commands may depend on the existence of
    temporary files, which will probably be deleted before you use the
    command file.

 o  Can pass arbitrary commands to the gnuplot command interpreter.

    Example:

        g('set pointsize 2')

    (If this is all you want to do, you might consider using the
    lightweight GnuplotProcess class defined in gp.py.)

 o  A Gnuplot object knows how to plot objects of type 'PlotItem'.
    Any PlotItem can have optional 'title' and/or 'with' suboptions.
    Builtin PlotItem types:
        
    * 'Data(array1)' -- data from a Python list or NumPy array
                        (permits additional option 'cols' )

    * 'File('filename')' -- data from an existing data file (permits
                            additional option 'using' )

    * 'Func('exp(4.0 * sin(x))')' -- functions (passed as a string,
                                     evaluated by gnuplot)

    * 'GridData(m, x, y)' -- data tabulated on a grid of (x,y) values
                             (usually to be plotted in 3-D)

    See the documentation strings for those classes for more details.

 o  PlotItems are implemented as objects that can be assigned to
    variables and plotted repeatedly.  Most of their plot options can
    also be changed with the new 'set_option()' member functions then
    they can be replotted with their new options.

 o  Communication of commands to gnuplot is via a one-way pipe.
    Communication of data from python to gnuplot is via inline data
    (through the command pipe) or via temporary files.  Temp files are
    deleted automatically when their associated 'PlotItem' is deleted.
    The PlotItems in use by a Gnuplot object at any given time are
    stored in an internal list so that they won't be deleted
    prematurely.

 o  Can use 'replot' method to add datasets to an existing plot.

 o  Can make persistent gnuplot windows by using the constructor option
    'persist=1'.  Such windows stay around even after the gnuplot
    program is exited.  Note that only newer version of gnuplot support
    this option.

 o  Can plot either directly to a postscript printer or to a
    postscript file via the 'hardcopy' method.

 o  Grid data for the splot command can be sent to gnuplot in binary
    format, saving time and disk space.

 o  Should work under Unix, Macintosh, and Windows.

Restrictions:
    
 -  Relies on the Numeric Python extension.  This can be obtained
    from LLNL (See ftp://ftp-icf.llnl.gov/pub/python/README.html).
    If you're interested in gnuplot, you would probably also want
    NumPy anyway.

 -  Only a small fraction of gnuplot functionality is implemented as
    explicit method functions.  However, you can give arbitrary
    commands to gnuplot manually.

    Example:

        g = Gnuplot.Gnuplot()
        g('set data style linespoints')
        g('set pointsize 5')

 -  There is no provision for missing data points in array data (which
    gnuplot allows via the 'set missing' command).

Bugs:

 -  No attempt is made to check for errors reported by gnuplot.  On
    unix any gnuplot error messages simply appear on stderr.  (I don't
    know what happens under Windows.)

 -  All of these classes perform their resource deallocation when
    '__del__' is called.  Normally this works fine, but there are
    well-known cases when Python's automatic resource deallocation
    fails, which can leave temporary files around.

class PlotItem:
    """Plotitem represents an item that can be plotted by gnuplot.

    For the finest control over the output, you can create 'PlotItems'
    yourself with additional keyword options, or derive new classes
    from 'PlotItem'.

    The handling of options is complicated by the attempt to allow
    options and their setting mechanism to be inherited conveniently.
    Note first that there are some options that can only be set in the
    constructor then never modified, and others that can be set in the
    constructor and/or modified using the set_option() member
    function.  The former are always processed within __init__.  The
    latter are always processed within set_option, which is called by
    the constructor.

    set_option is driven by a class-wide dictionary called
    _option_list, which maps option names to the function objects used
    to set or change them.  <setter> is a function object that takes
    two parameters: 'self' (the PlotItem instance) and the new 'value'
    requested for the option.  If <setter> is None, then the option is
    not allowed to be changed after construction and an exception is
    raised.

    Any PlotItem that needs to add options can add to this dictionary
    within its class definition.  Follow one of the examples in this
    file.  Alternatively it could override the set_option member
    function if it needed to do wilder things.

          must be passed to gnuplot's `plot' command for this item;

      '_options' -- a dictionary of (<option>,<string>) tuples
          corresponding to the plot options that have been set for
          this instance of the PlotItem.  <option> is the option as
          specified by the user; <string> is the string that needs to
          be set in the command line to set that option (or None if no
          string is needed).  Example:

        'data' must be a data array holding the values of a function

        gnuplot's 'splot' command.  Blank lines are included each time
        the value of x changes so that gnuplot knows to plot a surface
        through the data.

        If 'binary=1' then the data are written to a file in a binary
        format that 'splot' can understand.  Binary format is faster
        and usually saves disk space but is not human-readable.  If
        your version of gnuplot doesn't support binary format (it is a
        recently-added feature), this behavior can be disabled by

        unless you explicitly choose color=0.  Alternately you can

              to leave this option unspecified.
          'eps=<bool>' -- shorthand for 'mode="eps"'; asks gnuplot to
              generate encapsulated postscript.

              font-switching, superscripts, and subscripts in axis

              enhanced postscript; if this is the case set
              GnuplotOpts.prefer_enhanced_postscript=None.)
          'color=<bool>' -- if set, create a plot with color.  Default
              is to leave this option unchanged.
          'solid=<bool>' -- if set, force lines to be solid (i.e., not
              dashed).

              printing if your printer can handle it.  Actually this
              option is probably meaningless since hardcopy() can only
              print a single plot at a time.
